Intrusion is unauthorized malicious access to computer systems or networks, aiming to compromise their security, integrity, or availability. It includes hacking, malware attacks, data theft, and denial of service (DoS) attacks. Effective detection and prevention are crucial for maintaining system security.
Although various defensive measures are in place, such as firewalls, and multi-factor authentication, intrusions continue to pose a significant threat due to evolving attack methods and sophisticated techniques used by cybercriminals.
In recent years, advancements in cybersecurity, including the integration of machine learning, have shown promise in enhancing detection and response capabilities.
As intrusions become more complex, ongoing innovation and adaptation are crucial for improving cybersecurity defenses and protecting against potential attacks.
